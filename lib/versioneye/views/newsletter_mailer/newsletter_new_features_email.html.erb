      Rust is a blazingly fast new language which guarantees thread safety! Our latest project, a command line tool to identify random components by their SHA values, is implemented in Rust. As we use Rust for our own purposes we want to track Rust dependencies of course Thatâ€™s why added support for Rust now! VersionEye is tracking more than 9K Rust packages from crates.io now and they are all available through our public search.

      Beside that VersionEye can parse cargo.toml and cargo.lock files. If you are using cargo to manage your Rust dependencies then you can let VersionEye monitore those files to receive notifications about new releases of your dependencies.
